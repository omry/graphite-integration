Sends package install/remove/upgrade events to graphite
This means that you can get events into graphite whenever a package is installed/upgraded/removed in your system.
this infomration can be used as an overlay on your existing graphs with a target like:
    target=drawAsInfinite(events("package-name","intalled"))

Currently graphite url is hard coded to https://graphite/events/ (patches are welcome)

Testing:
    You can test multiple scenarios with the files in the samples directory:
    ./graphite-hook samples/install.sample
